'''Quarto: simple game to demonstrate the use of the python-webgame system.
This is a two player game.  Every turn, one player picks a piece and the other
player places it on the board.  The player who makes 4 in a row with a common
property wins.  There are four properties: size, color, open/closed and shape.
On the left are the pieces that can be selected, on the right is the board.

The main purpose of this game is to serve as an example for how games can be
made with the python-webgame module.  This is a simple example that only shows
the basics.
'''

# The module must always be imported.
import webgame

# The module reads some settings from global variables.  This defines that every game is played with two players.
num_players = 2

# Almost everything in the game is defined in the Game class, which must be named like this.
