## Requirements:
- [M.GRL](https://github.com/aeva/m.grl)
- [python-fhs](https://github.com/wijnen/python-fhs)
- [python-network](https://github.com/wijnen/python-network)
- [python-websocketd](https://github.com/wijnen/python-websocketd)
- [python-webgame](https://github.com/wijnen/python-webgame)
- [Blender](http://blender.org)
- bitmap image editor (possibly Blender, more likely
  [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org) or similar)
- Text editor, such as gedit.  Stay away from Microsoft editors; they put a BOM
  at the start of UTF-8 encoded text files, which breaks everything.

## Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of Javascript
- Model editing, rigging, and action editing in Blender
- Bitmap image editing

# Installation
If python-{fhs,network,websocketd} are not installed on the system, copy the
module files ({fhs,network,websocketd}.py) into the python-webgame directory.

Copy or link mgrl.js and demos/gl-matrix.js from the m.grl source into the html
directory of the python-webgame source.

In the m.grl source, go to apps/blender\_addon and create a zip of the code in
there using ``zip io_scene_jta.zip io_scene_jta/\*`` .  Open Blender, go through
user settings to addons and use the install from file button to install the
newly created zip file.

If you are using [vim](http://vim.org) as your text editor, you want to add this line to your .vimrc:

    autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead \*.gpy set filetype=python

It will make vim recognize \*.gpy files as python.

# Introduction
This tutorial teaches how to use Python-webgame through examples and
excercises.  Explanations are kept to a minimum.

The code for the examples is in the same place as this file, one directory per
example.  Every new feature is commented in the code.  Features that have been
explained in earlier code do not always have a comment again.  Only files that
are mentioned under "Read" have new material in them, but the other files may
still be useful to better understand concepts that were explained before.

## Example 0: Simple working (but useless) program: non-game
This program does nothing.  It shows the basic structure of a game written with
Python-webgame.  To make it work, just go to the directory that holds
non-game.gpy and run ``webgame-build``.  Then point a browser to
http://localhost:8891 to see the title screen.  When you create a game there,
it will show you an empty screen that only allows you to leave.

* Read: non-game.gpy
* Exercise: Make it run.

## Example 1: Simple working scene: static
This program displays some objects.  The objects have been designed in Blender.
The example uses the default monkey head with a texture that is all the same
color, which makes it hard to see that it is a monkey head.

* Read: static.gpy, html/static.js, html/monkey.blend
* Exercise: Design a different object and place three of them in a triangle.

## Example 2: Communication from the server to the clients: stop-motion
This is a stop motion scene, which demonstrates communication from the server
to the clients.

* Read: stop-motion.gpy, html/stop-motion.js
* Exercise: Create a scene with two actors and control them with the server.

## Example 3: Scripted client-side animations: scripted
Smooth animations can be scripted in javascript.  This example shows two ways:
the easy way, and the powerful way.

* Read: html/scripted.js
* Exercise: Make an animation with smooth motion and rotation.

## Example 4: Prepared client-side animations: prepared
Blender can edit actions for objects, and those actions are available in M.GRL
as well.  This example shows how to use them.

* Read: html/objects.blend, html/prepared.js
* Exercise: Create a walk action in Blender and use it in combination with a scripted move to make a walking character.

## Example 5: Communication from client to server: novel
This visual novel shows how the server can allow clients to send commands, and
how clients use it.

* Read: novel.gpy, html/novel.js
* Exercise: Add animations.

## Example 6: Object picking: flip
This game demonstrates how to respond to objects being clicked.

* Read: html/flip.js
* Exercise: Create a short point and click adventure.

## Example 7: More complex yield expressions: quarto
This example shows how to yield a dict to allow control over what commands are
allowed.  Note that this game documents everything (including things that were
documented before), because it was written as a standalone example.

* Read: quarto.gpy, html/quarto.js
* Excercise: Create tic tac toe

## Example 8: Generated textures: the game
This example shows how to use a canvas that was generated in Javascript instead
of one that was assigned in Blender.

* Read: html/thegame.js, html/tile.blend
* Exercise: Create minesweeper.

## Example 9: Multiple execution threads: take 5
This example shows how Tasks can be used to simplify the implementation of a
game where things happen in parallel, such as all players preparing their turn
simultaneously.  Don't worry: no multi-threading is involved; everything is
handled from a main loop.

* Read: take5.gpy
* Exercise: Create scissors, paper, rock.

## Example 10: 2-D interface: dvonn
The 2-D system of m.grl to allow computers with less resources to play the
game.

* Read: html/img-2d/README.txt, html/dvonn.js
* Excercise: Adapt tic tac toe to 2-D; keep a copy of the 3-D version.

# To be done
The following is a plan for the rest of this tutorial; this part has not been made yet.

## Example 11: Multi-dimensional output
This merges examples 7 and 10, allowing clients to choose if they want to use
the 2-D or 3-D interface for the game.

* Read: html/quarto.js
* Excercise: Adapt tic tac toe to allow both 2-D and 3-D clients.

## Example 12: Generated 2-D content
Once again quarto is adapted; this time the 2-D version is changed so the tiles
are generated instead of used as images.

* Read: html/quarto.js
* Excercise: Generate the 2-D tiles for tic tac toe.

## Example 13: Events from server
In rare cases, the server may need to send events.  Note that a client that
connects after the event happened cannot see that it did.  Therefore, events
should only be used for things that do not change the state of the game.

## Example 14: Walk animations
This example shows how to use a walking animation so the character walks in the
direction of movement.

* Excercise: ?
